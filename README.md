# Project 5/50

Blurry loading screen with a little percentage that reduces as the opacity gets reset. I could see myself
using this for elements on the page after a 'click' event listener perhaps to reveal an element, like a present. I'm doing these mini-projects to really see the possibilities that working with Javascript could entail.
